Hello,
I am a self-taught retired hobbyist with Ubuntu 24 x 7 server hosting several websites and streaming audio using liquidsoap and shoutcast.
I worked for Hewlett Packard for 28 years as hardware design engineer, software engineer, R&D Project Manager and R&D Section Manager.
I learned Unix at work. Since retiring I've learned html, css and php. I've used liquidsoap since version 1.4 and am still a novice.
I just installed a new server with Ubuntu 24.04, nginx, mariadb, php8.3, shoutcast and liquidsoap 2.2.4.
